# Decisions

One line per decision. Newest phase at the bottom. The system paper wins if a line here disagrees with it.

## System paper v1.1, section 15

- D1: Two apps, a Next.js storefront and a Vite dashboard, sharing three packages (ui, core, api); the dashboard ships to iOS and Android later with Capacitor.
- D2: No admin screen at launch; the founder approves shops and records payments with SQL.
- D3: No POS, kitchen display or staff at launch; Messenger hand-off instead.
- D4: Members and stamps are in the launch version; they are the selling point.
- D5: A member is a customer with member_since set (a linked login).
- D6: Money, stock and stamps change only in database functions; simple owner edits use row-level security write rules.
- D7: Demo data lives in SQL in the database (seed.sql and demo_reset), reset from the SQL editor with no AI tokens.
- D8: Shop look is logo, cover and three colours (60/30/10); the editor comes later.
- D9: ₱599 per month early plan; tools break even at about 5 shops.
- D10: Same database design as the first build, trimmed; later features plug in without renaming tables.
- D11: Fixed places for code: apps (screens), ui (design), core (rules), api (data), supabase (database); lint enforces it.

## Build plan v1.1, "Before phase 1"

- B1: Two apps, Next.js storefront and Vite dashboard: yes.
- B2: Three shared packages, ui, core, api: yes.
- B3: Approvals and subscriptions by SQL, as saved snippets in the Supabase SQL editor: yes.
- B4: Order types at launch are walk-in, pickup and delivery; dine-in and shipping right after launch: yes.
- B5: Members and stamps in the launch version: yes.
- B6: Demo data in SQL inside Supabase (demo_reset run from the SQL editor): yes.
- B7: Reuse proven code from the first repo as copy-and-trim reference in reference/, never whole folders: yes.
- B8: Platform domain: pick one short domain (needed for Resend, app.domain and shop links). Open: not chosen yet; needed by Phase 2.6.

## Phase 1

- P1-1: Package scope is `@smartapp/*`.
- P1-2: The enum values in packages/core/src/schemas/enums.ts are the only allowed values; the database CHECK constraints will mirror them.
- P1-3: Database function names follow system paper 7.4 exactly (create_my_shop, get_storefront, get_order, shop_settings table…).
- P1-4: TypeScript fields are camelCase; packages/api maps them to snake_case columns.
- P1-5: OrderEvent has no actor field yet: actor (customer, owner, system) is not in the agreed enum list; add it with the order engine migration (P5.3).
- P1-6: Node 24 LTS is enforced (`engines` + `engine-strict`); pnpm is pinned with `packageManager`.
- P1-7: The two apps have placeholder typecheck and lint scripts until Phase 2 gives them source (tsc fails on an empty project).
- P1-8: `tooling/` is a workspace package (`@smartapp/tooling`) so the lint rule tests run inside `pnpm check`.
- P1-9: Reference code is copied from the first repo's newest branch, `redesign/v3-home` (commit dff6bf9), because main lacks the order rules and upload code.

## UI decisions (2026-10-11, before Phase 2)

- UI-1: The UI kit is 51 components mapped to MVP screens (`docs/ui-kit.md`), installed in P2; more only when a screen needs one.
- UI-2: The phone dock has no raised centre button at launch (its job was Sell/POS, which is not in the MVP).
- UI-3: Category icons are a Fluent 3D icon (curated, self-hosted, from Microsoft's MIT `fluentui-emoji`), an emoji, or an uploaded photo. Built in P4.5, stored in P5.1 (`categories.icon_kind`, `icon_value`).

## Phase 2

- P2-1: Storefront is light-only at launch, themed by the shop's 60/30/10 colours; the dashboard has light and dark.
- P2-2: Migrations reach the hosted project only through the `db-deploy` GitHub Action on `dev`.
- P2-3: Words live in `packages/core/src/words.ts`; Menu/Products-style words come from `VOCAB[businessType]` only.
- P2-4: Auth emails use 6-digit codes only (no links), sent by Resend SMTP from mail.webserbisyo.com.
- P2-5: Platform domain is `webserbisyo.com`, used only through subdomains so the existing site is untouched: storefront `shop.webserbisyo.com/<slug>`, dashboard `app.webserbisyo.com`, auth email from `mail.webserbisyo.com`.
- P2-6: The UI kit is the 51 components in `docs/ui-kit.md`, installed in P2 (not P4); more only when a screen needs one.
- P2-7: Shop colours reach the storefront only as `--shop-60/30/10` (+ `-foreground`) through `ShopTheme`; shared components keep the platform tokens, so a Button looks the same in both apps.
- P2-8: The shadcn CLI's `cn` package is replaced by our own `cn` (clsx + tailwind-merge) in `packages/ui/src/lib/utils.ts`; `next-themes` is not used (the Toaster reads the `.dark` class).
- P2-9: ReUI data-grid keeps only the base table, header, filter, visibility, pagination and scroll-area files; its drag, virtual and cell-selection variants were removed (not in the MVP), and so was `@tanstack/react-virtual`.
- P2-10: The chart-pie-donut-text block exists only in shadcn's Radix style, so it was copied from that registry and pointed at our Base UI card and chart.
- P2-11: CSS custom properties in `style` are typed by augmenting React's `CSSProperties` (`packages/ui/src/lib/style.ts`, `cssVars()`), so no component casts.
- P2-12: Dashboard module pages use one splat route (`/$`) and the registry picks the screen; `/kit` is its own route, outside the nav.
- P2-13: Type packages (`@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `@types/node`, `@types/canvas-confetti`) were added as dev dependencies; they ship no runtime code.


## Backend plan (2026-10-11, approved by the founder)

Recommended in the "Plan backend: P3a, P3b, P5" thread and approved by the founder on 2026-10-11. The checkpoint
prompts build them; their P5 numbers stay the same so later checkpoints add only the other P5 lines.

- P5-5: Only GCash, Maya and bank orders expire unpaid (`orders.expires_at`, default 30 minutes); cash and COD
  orders wait for the owner. Why: a cash customer may arrive late and still pay; an unpaid transfer order would
  otherwise hold stock forever.
- P5-6: Cloudflare Turnstile moves to P6. Until then `place_order` is limited in the database: at most 3 unpaid
  orders per phone per 30 minutes and 30 orders per shop per minute. Why: fewer moving parts for launch, and the
  limits stop the same spam without a third-party script.
- P5-10: A member's past guest orders are linked to their account only with proof: an order token from that phone,
  or the same email. Otherwise joining asks them to join from a receipt. Why: anyone can type someone else's phone
  number; linking by phone alone would show strangers another person's orders and stamps.
- P5-13: The two shops made in P3b, Juan's Cafe (`juans-cafe`, food) and Tala Apparel (`tala-apparel`, retail),
  become the demo shops: `select private.demo_setup();` (P5.2) fills them with a real catalog, and
  `private.demo_reset` (P5.6) refills them with orders. Why: one pair of test shops for every checkpoint, owned by the
  founder, with no second set to keep in step.
- P5-14: No mock data in the apps. Each P4 screens step runs after the P5 step that builds its API, and screens call
  only the names in `docs/api-surface.md`. Why: screens built on fake data had to be rewired in the first build.
- P5-15: Deleting payment proofs after 30 days moves to P6 (needs an Edge Function or a scheduled script; Supabase
  blocks deleting storage files from SQL).
- P5-16: Every new member gets 1 welcome stamp when they join a shop whose stamp card is on (ledger reason
  `welcome`, once per member per shop; built in P5.5). Why: a card that starts with a stamp already filled gets
  finished faster, and it gives guests a reason to join from the receipt (screens thread decision F4, approved by
  the founder 2026-10-11).
